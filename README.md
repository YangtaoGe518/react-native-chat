# React Native Chat

The basic requirements of the app:

* Login screen (accounts can be hard coded in the app as JSON files)
* Contacts screen (all data can be hard coded as JSON files)
* Must be possible to select a contact and exchange messages with them
* If the app is terminated and relaunched the chat history must still be there

## Prerequisites
You should have following software / executable files installed and are available via command line:
* Node.js ( >= 14.x )
* Expo SDK ( = 29.x )
* Yarn
* Expo-cli

## Demo

```
git clone https://github.com/YangtaoGe518/react-native-chat.git
```
