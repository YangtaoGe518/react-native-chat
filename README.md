# React Native Chat
Coding Challenge to build a simple react native chat app

The basic requirements of the app:

* Login screen (accounts can be hard coded in the app as JSON files)

* Must be possible to select a contact and exchange messages with them
* If the app is terminated and relaunched the chat history must still be there
